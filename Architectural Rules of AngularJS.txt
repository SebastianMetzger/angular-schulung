Architectural Rules of AngularJS
================================

# Big Picture:
- One Controller per screen/route for most use cases enough!
- Model === Service
-- Create a Service per Model Entity

# Model:
- Auto persist model via $watch.$on
- Use $rootScope as event system

# Scope:
- Don't use scope to directly share data between multiple controllers

# Views:
- No complex logic or data manipulation in the view, only view related things!

# HTTP
- Learn and faciliate the promise pattern awesomeness
